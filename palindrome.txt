dammit im mad
evil is a deed as i live
god am i reviled i rise my bed on a sun i melt
to be not one man emanating is sad i piss
alas it is so late who stops to help
man it is hot im in it i tell
i am not a devil i level mad dog
ah say burning is as a deified gulp
in my halo of a mired rum tin
i erase many men oh to be man a sin
is evil in a clam in a trap
no it is open on it i was stuck
rats peed on hope elsewhere dips a web
be still if i fill its ebb
ew a spider eh
we sleep oh no
deep stark cuts saw it in one position
part animal can i live sin is a name
both one my names are in it
murder im a fool
a hymn i plug deified as a sign in ruby ash
a goddam level i lived at
on mail let it in im it
oh, sit in ample hot spots oh wet
a loss it is alas sip id assign it a name
name not one bottle minus an ode by me
sir i deliver im a dog
evil is a deed as i live
dammit i'm mad
